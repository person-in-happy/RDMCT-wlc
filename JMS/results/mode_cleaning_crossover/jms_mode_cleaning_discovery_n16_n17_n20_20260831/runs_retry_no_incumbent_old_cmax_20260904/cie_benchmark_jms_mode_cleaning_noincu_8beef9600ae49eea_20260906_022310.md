## Paired evidence for the proposed method

- Claim-ready gate: **NOT YET PASSED**
- Rule: For every baseline: >=10 valid pairs, mean PDI improvement >=5%, win rate >=60%, no lower incumbent rate, and Holm-adjusted p<0.05.

| Proposed vs. | All pairs | PDI pairs | Base/Prop incumbent rate | Wins | Win rate | Mean PDI improvement | Wilcoxon p | Holm p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Paired secondary effects

Positive objective/time improvement and positive absolute gap reduction favor Proposed.

| Proposed vs. | Objective pairs | Mean objective improvement | Gap pairs | Mean absolute gap reduction | Both-optimal time pairs | Mean time improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Controlled module effects (PDI)

Each row changes one module while holding the paired checkpoint family and decode setting fixed where applicable.

| Effect | Baseline -> Target | Pairs | Win rate | Mean improvement | Median improvement |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| beam_without_structure | HEM -> HEM + Beam | 0 | n/a | n/a% | n/a% |
| structure_with_greedy | HEM -> HEM + Structure | 0 | n/a | n/a% | n/a% |
| structure_with_beam | HEM + Beam -> Proposed | 0 | n/a | n/a% | n/a% |
| beam_with_structure | HEM + Structure -> Proposed | 0 | n/a | n/a% | n/a% |

## Interpretation guardrails

- Compare methods only on identical instance-seed pairs.
- Metric directions: solving time, PAR-2, best objective, gap, and PDI are all lower-is-better for these minimization models.
- Best objective measures incumbent quality; gap measures remaining certificate uncertainty; PDI measures anytime primal-dual progress; time is a speed claim only when solve outcomes are comparable.
- Mean node count is diagnostic, not a monotone quality metric: fewer nodes can mean an efficient tree or a stalled root relaxation.
- Report timeout-aware gap and primal-dual integral beside wall-clock time.
- `adaptive_cutsel` is the original four-parameter SCIP hybrid selector interface. It is the full learned ACS method only when `--acs_predictions` contains held-out predictions from a separately trained ACS model.
- `hem` requires a separately trained 13-feature checkpoint; using the 23-feature checkpoint would invalidate the ablation.
- `hem_beam` reuses the exact HEM checkpoint and changes only greedy to beam decoding.
- `hem_structure` reuses the exact Proposed checkpoint and structure reranking, changing only beam to greedy decoding.
- `a3c` and `beam_search` share the same independently trained flat-A3C checkpoint and differ only in greedy versus beam decoding.
- `proposed` uses the separately trained 23-feature role-submodular checkpoint; every method receives the same SCIP, memory, warm-start, instance, and solver-seed limits.
- Schedule wait and cadence metrics are observational in the benchmark; no method receives an extra postprocessing budget.
